<h1> Hi there</h1>
<p> My name is Salina and I will be a Macaulay Honors freshman at City College's Grove School of Engineering. I like food. And I am a night owl. I am very into trying new things, but at the same time, I am also very fickle so many things I try are often left in a pile of unfinished projects. </p>
