My group and I are called CAST. It stands for 
Capability Assisitance Service Team

<font size="4">
Our group is made up of four members: 
<ol>Assiatou </ol>
<ol>Jeissy </ol>
<ol>Aliyah </ol>
<ol> and me (Salina) </ol>

Do want to do something spontaneous or fun with a big group of people? Or have your friends' and your own schedules clashed to make you unable to hang-out together? If you have had these problems, what about hanging out with people who have the same or even different interests as you forjust a day? It's a fun and non-commital way of having fun because all you have to bring is yourself! And you can use our platform as a way to make new friends. If you and the people you meet don't click, it's OKAY! You won't need to see them again after your one day of fun!
Come and try it out!
