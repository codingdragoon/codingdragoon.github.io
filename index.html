<h1> Hi there</h1>
<body>
<p> My name is Salina and I will be a Macaulay Honors freshman at City College's Grove School of Engineering. I like food. And I am a night owl. I am very into trying new things, but at the same time, I am also very fickle so many things I try are often left in a pile of unfinished projects. </p>
<p> I am currently learning how to code in HTML for the first time and I find it a bit too difficult for me to follow at times.</p>
